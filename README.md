# Variations On Regression and Interpolation Methods

## Polynomial Regression
Regularization techniques like L1 (LASSO), L2 (Ridge), and generalizations of Elastic Net.
Also includes implamentations with orthogonal polynomials rather than monomials and alternatives 
to ordinary least squares (least absolute deviates, non-normal residuals, etc.)

## Splines 
Similar to Polynomial Regression but not as extensive.
