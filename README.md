# Variations On Regression and Interpolation Methods

## Polynomial Regression
Regularization techniques like L1 (LASSO), L2 (Ridge), and generalizations of Elastic Net.
Also includes implamentations with orthogonal polynomials rather than monomials and alternatives 
to ordinary least squares (least absolute deviates, non-normal residuals, etc.)

## Splines 
Similar to Polynomial Regression but not as extensive. 

## Polynomial Basis Study
Main thing to look at here is the jupyter notebook. It looks at how a monomial basis performs
relative to a set of orthogonal polynomials in iterative algorithms like gradient descent.
